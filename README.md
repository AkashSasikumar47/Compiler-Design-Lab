# Compiler Design Lab

This repository contains various programs developed as part of the Compiler Design Lab course. Each program focuses on different aspects of compiler design, including lexical analysis, parsing, and syntax tree generation.

## Programs

### BasicJavaProgram.java
A simple Java program demonstrating basic concepts used in compiler design.

### CapitalLetters.lex
Lexical analyzer specification for recognizing capital letters using Lex.

### ComputationOfFirst.c
C program to compute the FIRST sets for a given grammar.

### First&Follow.c
C program to compute both the FIRST and FOLLOW sets for a given grammar.

### CG.java
Java program related to code generation in compiler design.

### LeftFactoring.c
C program to perform left factoring on a given grammar.

### LeftRecursion.c
C program to eliminate left recursion from a given grammar.

### Operators&Identifiers.lex
Lexical analyzer specification for recognizing operators and identifiers using Lex.

### PredictiveParser.cpp
C++ program implementing a predictive parser for a given grammar.

### ScannerByRegularExpression
Program to create a scanner using regular expressions.

### SLRParser.cpp
C++ program implementing an SLR parser for a given grammar.

### SyntaxTreeArithmetic.java
Java program to generate a syntax tree for arithmetic expressions.

## Usage

To run any of these programs, follow the standard compilation and execution procedures for the respective programming languages (C, C++, Java, and Lex).
